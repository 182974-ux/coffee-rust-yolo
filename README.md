## Introduction
we present YOLO-FD, a multi-task learning network specifically designed for simultaneous detection and segmentation.
YOLO-FD extends the YOLOv8 backbone by integrating a novel semantic segmentation branch dedicated to precisely segmenting infected areas in diseased fish, 
while retaining the original object detection branch for identifying infected fish.
The main contributions of **YOLO-FD**  are as follows:
*	**Integrating a novel semantic segmentation branch into the YOLOv8 network**
*	**Proposing a multi-task learning network YOLO-FD for detection and segmentation**
*	**Weight uncertainty and PCGrad are employed to YOLO-FD**
*	**Achieving accurate fish disease detection and assessment of fish disease severity**
